      Afterwards I started experimenting with Java and worked on 2 eCommerce projects, one using Spring Boot and Hibernate
      and one using SAP Hybris. However, after about a year and a half, I returned to my first love: Ruby ðŸ˜„.

      I've worked for 2 years on a huge Golf Tournament Management System helping me become a true Senior Engineer
      and even being promoted to a management position inside the company for a short while.

      Lately I've discovered freelancing and my goal slowly became helping business owners build solid web systems
      that would finally allow them more time for their personal lives while also increasing their revenues.
      So far I've worked with businesses in the US as well as in Ireland and all the feedback I received
      was extremely positive.
      <br/><br/>
      So let's get in touch and start working on the business and life of your dreams ðŸš€
